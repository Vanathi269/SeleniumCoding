1. Mention the three-build lifecycle of Maven ?
	There are three built-in build lifecycles: default, clean and site. 
	The default lifecycle handles your project deployment, 
	The clean lifecycle handles project cleaning, 
	while the site lifecycle handles the creation of your project's web site.
	
2. Explain what is Maven artifact ?
	In Maven terminology, an artifact is an output generated after a Maven project build. 
	It can be, for example, a jar, war, or any other executable file. 
	Also, Maven artifacts include five key elements, groupId, artifactId, version, packaging, and classifier.
	
3. List out the dependency scope in Maven ?
	Maven distinguishes six dependency scopes: compile, runtime, test, provided, system and import.

4. Write the command to perform a force update in Maven ?
	We can force update in maven by using –U options by using mvn clean install command. 
	In that –U means force update the dependencies of the snapshot.
	
5. What are the different types of profile in Maven? Where will you define these profiles?
	Per project---------> pom.xml
	Per User/Developer-------> Maven settings.xml 
	Global-----------> Maven global settings.xml 
	
6. How will you run test classes in Maven ?
	The Maven surefire plugin provides a test parameter that we can use to specify test classes or methods we want to execute. 
	If we want to execute a single test class, we can execute the command mvn test -Dtest=”TestClassName”. 
	As the output shows, only the test class we've passed to the test parameter is executed.
