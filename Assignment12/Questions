1.Why do we use Listener?
	Listener is defined as interface that modifies the default TestNG's behavior. 
	As the name suggests Listeners “listen” to the event defined in the selenium script and behave accordingly. 
	It is used in selenium by implementing Listeners Interface. It allows customizing TestNG reports or logs.

2.What are the type of Listener in TestNg ?
-Listeners are implemented in code via interfaces to modify TestNG behaviour. 
	-Listed below are the most commonly used TestNG listeners:

-IAnnotationTransformer
	IAnnotationTransformer is an interface that provides a method
	 “transform” which would get invoked by TestNG to modify the behaviour of Test annotation method in our test class.
-IExecutionListener
	 IExecutionListener is used to to monitor when a TestNG run starts and ends.
-IHookable
	IHookable: If a class implements this interface, its run method will be invoked instead of each test method
-IInvokedMethodListener
	IInvokedMethodListener allows user to perform certain action before/after 
	a method has been executed - something like clean up or setup. 
-IMethodInterceptor
	IMethodInterceptor is used to alter/modify the list of test methods to be executed by TestNG
-IReporter
	This listener helps to generate custom reports in TestNG, based on desired conditions
-ISuiteListener
	ISuiteListener is another type of listener provided in TestNG. The ISuiteListener works on the suite level.
-ITestListener
	ITestListener listens to the desired events and executes the methods accordingly.
	
3.Write steps to implement TestNg listener ?
	 Write the business logic of your test and insert TestNG annotations in your code. Add the information about your test 
	 (e.g. the class name, the groups you wish to run, etc...) in a testng.xml file or in build.xml. Run TestNG.
	 
4.How to re-run TestNgFailed Tests using Auto Retry mechanism ?
	After the first run of an automated test run. Right click on Project – Click on Refresh.
	A folder will be generated named “test-output” folder. Inside “test-output” folder, you could find “testng-failed. xml”
	Run “testng-failed. xml” to execute the failed test cases again.
