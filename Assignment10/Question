1. What is the difference between @BeforeTest and @BeforeMethod annotation ?
	@BeforeMethod is invoked before each method with a @Test annotation. @BeforeTest is invoked before a <test> tag.
	
2. Mention the TestNg annotations execution sequence ?
	1.@BeforeSuite.
	2.@BeforeTest.
	3.@BeforeClass.
	4.@BeforeMethod.
	5.@Test.
	6.@AfterMethod.
	7.@AfterClass.
	8.@AfterTest.
	
3. Difference between Hard assert and soft assert in TestNg ?
	Hard Asserts are used when you want to halt the execution of the test script (or test method) when the assert condition 
	does not match with the expected result. 
	Soft Asserts are used when the test script (or test method) need not be halted when the assertion condition does not meet the expected result.
	
4. How to write soft assertion in TestNg ?
	Soft Assert does not throw an exception when an assert fails and would continue with the next step after the assert statement. 
	If there is any exception and you want to throw it then you need to use assertAll() method as a last statement in the @Test and test suite again continue with next @Test as it is.
