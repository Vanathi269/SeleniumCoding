PRIORITY:
	-Definition of Priority in TestNG test methods can only be the @Test methods.
	-Lower the priority number; higher is the priority of the test case method.
	-Priority in TestNG contains only integer value. The value can be negative, zero, or positive.
	-One method is allowed to have only one priority in TestNG.
	-Priority cannot pass through the XML files
	
	
	SYNTAX:
		@Test(priority=(number to execute the with priority)
		public void method(){
		body of the method
		}
		
HOOK:
	-hook is that even in case of test fail, after hook will execute for sure.
	
	
	IMPLEMENTATION OF HOOK IN CUCUMBER:
		Feature: Test Hooks

		Scenario: This scenario is to test hooks functionality
		Given this is the first step
		When this is the second step
		Then this is the third step
		
ASSERTION:
	-Actual is the first parameter that describes the value that the user gets during the execution of the test script
	 Assert is the Class provided by the TestNG framework. 
	 methodName is the name of the method that can be used for implementing TestNG assertions. 
	
	
	SYNTAX:
		methodName(actual, expected);
		
TYPES OF ASSERTION:
There are two types of TestNg Assert:

Hard Assert
Soft Assert
	-Hard Assert in TestNG
		Hard Asserts are those asserts that stop the test execution when an assert statement fails,
		and the subsequent assert statements are therefore not validated.

 	 -Soft Assert in TestNG
		Soft asserts are just the opposite of hard asserts.
 		In soft asserts, the subsequent assertions keep on running even though one assert validation fails,
ANNOTATIONS:
	â€“Used to describe the batch of code in a method
	-Some of the annotations are and they are written in execution prior 
		@test,
		@Before method, 
		@Before class, 
		@Before test, 
		@Before suite, 
		@After method, 
		@After class, 
		@After test, 
		@After suite
		
		SYNTAX:
		
		@ANNOTATION
		public void method_name(){
		body of the method
		}
