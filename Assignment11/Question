1.How can we create a data-driven framework using TestNG ?
	 Step 1: Go to the Eclipse IDE and create a project. Add all the dependencies for TestNG, Selenium and Apache POI. 
	 Step 2: Create a class file to write the functionality.
	 
2.What is the difference between DataProvider and parameters in TestNG ?
	DataProviders pass the different parameters on a single test in a single execution, 
	whereas parameters pass the parameters just once per execution in TestNG.
	
3.Can we use DataProvider in BeforeTest ?
	It is not possible to use data providers with @BeforeTest (and maybe any other @BeforeX methods), 
	but you can use a before @Test method, where all other @Test methods are dependent ( dependsOnMethods ): 
	@Test(dataProvider="dp") public void beforeTest(<params...>)
	
4.What are the four main objects of data provider 
	Connection--->	It is used to establish a connection to a specific data source.
	Command--->	It is used to execute queries to perform database operations.
	DataReader--->	It is used to read data from data source. The DbDataReader is a base class for all DataReader objects.
	DataAdapter--->	It populates a DataSet and resolves updates with the data source. The base class for all DataAdapter objects is the DbDataAdapter class.
